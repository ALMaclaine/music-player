### High-Level Project Plan for Building the Music Player App

Building a comprehensive music player app using **Next.js**, **SQLite**, **Nx**, **Radix and Shadcn**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Zustand** involves multiple phases, from initial setup to deployment and maintenance. Below is a structured high-level plan to guide you through the development process.

---

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning**

1. **Define Project Scope & Requirements**
  - Review and finalize all app features and requirements.
  - Prioritize features into MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and future enhancements.

2. **Set Up Monorepo with Nx**
  - Initialize an Nx workspace to manage frontend and backend codebases.
  - Configure project structure for scalability and maintainability.

3. **Version Control & Collaboration**
  - Initialize a Git repository.
  - Set up branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow) for efficient collaboration.
  - Configure access controls and repository permissions.

4. **Environment Setup**
  - Install necessary tools and dependencies (Node.js, Next.js, SQLite, etc.).
  - Configure development environments for frontend and backend.
  - Set up environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., database credentials).

#### **Phase 2: Database Design & Backend Development**

1. **Design SQLite Database Schema**
  - **Users Table**: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `profile_preferences`, etc.
  - **Playlists Table**: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `created_at`, etc.
  - **Songs Table**: `id`, `title`, `artist`, `album`, `duration`, `file_path`, etc.
  - **Playlist_Songs Table**: `playlist_id`, `song_id`, `order`, etc.
  - **Preferences Table**: `id`, `user_id`, `theme`, `playback_settings`, etc.

2. **Set Up ORM or Database Access Layer**
  - Choose an ORM (e.g., Prisma) or a lightweight library for SQLite interactions.
  - Implement models and migrations for database schema.

3. **Develop Next.js API Routes**
  - **Authentication Endpoints**: `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`.
  - **User Management Endpoints**: `/api/user/profile`, `/api/user/preferences`.
  - **Playlist Management Endpoints**: `/api/playlists`, `/api/playlists/[id]`.
  - **Music Serving Endpoints**: `/api/music/stream/[songId]`, `/api/music/download/[songId]`.

4. **Implement Security Measures**
  - Encrypt user passwords using bcrypt or similar.
  - Implement JWT or session-based authentication.
  - Validate and sanitize all API inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

#### **Phase 3: Frontend Development**

1. **Set Up Next.js Frontend**
  - Initialize Next.js within the Nx monorepo.
  - Configure routing, page structures, and layout components.

2. **Integrate Tailwind CSS**
  - Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Set up Tailwind's configuration file for custom themes and responsive design.

3. **Implement UI Components with Radix and Shadcn**
  - Build accessible components like modals, dropdowns, navigation bars, and buttons.
  - Ensure consistency and reusability of UI components across the app.

4. **Develop Core Features**

  - **User Authentication & Profile Management**
    - Create signup and login pages with form validation.
    - Develop profile management interfaces for updating user information and preferences.

  - **Music Playback**
    - Build the music player interface with controls (play, pause, next, previous, seek, volume).
    - Implement playback queue management and shuffle/repeat functionalities.
    - Integrate offline playback capabilities using service workers or IndexedDB.

  - **Playlist Management**
    - Design interfaces for creating, editing, reordering (with drag-and-drop), and deleting playlists.
    - Implement default playlists (Favorites, Recently Played, Downloaded).

  - **Navigation & UI/UX**
    - Develop a responsive left-side navigation bar.
    - Implement the "Now Playing" bar that persists across different views.
    - Add light/dark mode toggling with state persistence.

5. **State Management with Zustand**
  - Set up global state stores for current song, playlists, playback settings, and offline status.
  - Ensure state persistence across sessions using Zustand middleware (e.g., localStorage).

---

#### **Phase 4: Integration & Testing**

1. **Integrate Frontend with Backend APIs**
  - Connect frontend components with API routes for data fetching and mutations.
  - Handle authentication tokens and secure API requests.

2. **File Management**
  - Organize and manage local music files within the project structure.
  - Ensure efficient serving and streaming of music files via API routes.

3. **Implement Performance Optimizations**
  - Apply lazy loading for album artwork, playlists, and track lists.
  - Utilize Next.js SSR for faster initial page loads and SEO benefits.
  - Optimize database queries and API responses for speed.

4. **Testing**
  - **Unit Testing**: Write tests for individual components, utilities, and API endpoints using frameworks like Jest.
  - **Integration Testing**: Ensure that different parts of the app work together seamlessly.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Use tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user interactions and workflows.
  - **Accessibility Testing**: Verify that UI components meet accessibility standards (WCAG).

---

#### **Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance**

1. **Prepare for Deployment**
  - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel for Next.js, Heroku, AWS).
  - Configure build scripts and environment variables for production.

2. **Deploy the Application**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
  - Deploy the backend and frontend, ensuring proper connectivity and performance.

3. **Monitor & Optimize**
  - Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry for error tracking, Google Analytics for user behavior).
  - Collect user feedback for continuous improvement.

4. **Maintain and Scale**
  - Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities.
  - Optimize database performance and scale infrastructure as user base grows.

---

#### **Phase 6: Future Enhancements (Bonus Features)**

1. **Push Notifications**
  - Integrate push notification services to alert users about new playlists or music.

2. **Lyrics Display**
  - Connect to a lyrics API to fetch and display song lyrics.

3. **Real-Time Collaboration**
  - Enable sharing and collaborative editing of playlists using WebSockets or similar technologies.

4. **Enhanced Offline Support**
  - Improve offline capabilities with better caching strategies and data synchronization.
