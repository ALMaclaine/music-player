# Documentation Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt guides the process of creating and updating project documentation, ensuring that the project is well-documented and easy to understand for all stakeholders.

## Steps

1. **Identify Documentation Needs**
   - Determine what aspects of the project require documentation (e.g., setup, API, user guide, architecture).
   - Prioritize based on current project phase and stakeholder needs.

2. **Choose Documentation Type**
   - Decide on the appropriate type of documentation (e.g., README, API docs, inline comments, wiki).
   - Consider the target audience (developers, end-users, project managers).

3. **Set Up Documentation Tools**
   - Choose and set up appropriate documentation tools (e.g., JSDoc, Swagger for API, Markdown for general docs).
   - Ensure necessary plugins or extensions are installed in the development environment.

4. **Create Documentation Structure**
   - Outline the main sections of the documentation.
   - Ensure a logical flow of information from general to specific.

5. **Write Documentation Content**
   - Use clear, concise language appropriate for the target audience.
   - Include examples, code snippets, and diagrams where appropriate.
   - Ensure all crucial information is covered (e.g., installation steps, configuration options, usage examples).

6. **Review and Refine**
   - Proofread the documentation for clarity, completeness, and accuracy.
   - Seek feedback from team members or potential users.
   - Update based on feedback and any recent project changes.

7. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Ensure consistent formatting, tone, and terminology throughout the documentation.
   - Use style guides if available (e.g., Google Developer Documentation Style Guide).

8. **Version Control**
   - Commit documentation changes along with related code changes.
   - Use clear commit messages for documentation updates.

9. **Keep Documentation Updated**
   - Regularly review and update documentation to reflect the current state of the project.
   - Remove or archive outdated information.

10. **Make Documentation Accessible**
    - Ensure documentation is easily accessible to its intended audience.
    - Consider hosting options (e.g., GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs) for public projects.

Remember that good documentation is crucial for project maintainability and user adoption. Strive for clarity, accuracy, and completeness in all documentation efforts.
