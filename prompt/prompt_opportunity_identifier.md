# Prompt Opportunity Identifier

## Purpose
This prompt helps identify situations where creating a new prompt would be beneficial for encapsulating repeatable actions or processes in the project.

## Steps

1. **Observe Patterns**
   - Look for actions or processes that are performed repeatedly throughout the project.
   - Identify tasks that require a consistent approach or methodology.

2. **Evaluate Complexity**
   - Consider if the action or process involves multiple steps.
   - Determine if the action requires specific knowledge or context that could be standardized.

3. **Assess Impact**
   - Evaluate how often this action or process is likely to be performed.
   - Consider the potential time savings and consistency improvements from having a dedicated prompt.

4. **Check Existing Prompts**
   - Review the prompt_index.md to ensure a similar prompt doesn't already exist.
   - Consider if an existing prompt could be modified or expanded instead of creating a new one.

5. **Define Scope**
   - Clearly outline what the potential new prompt would cover.
   - Identify the key steps or guidelines that would be included in the prompt.

6. **Consider Flexibility**
   - Ensure the potential prompt would be flexible enough to handle variations of the task.
   - Think about how the prompt could be made adaptable for future needs.

7. **Propose Creation**
   - If a new prompt seems beneficial, propose its creation using the create_prompt_prompt.md.
   - Outline the purpose, potential structure, and expected benefits of the new prompt.

## Example Situations for New Prompts

- Setting up new development tools or environments
- Implementing specific design patterns or architectural styles
- Conducting code reviews with consistent criteria
- Troubleshooting common issues or errors
- Onboarding new team members or contributors
- Preparing for and conducting project meetings or stand-ups
- Documenting features or API endpoints

Remember, the goal is to streamline processes, improve consistency, and make the development workflow more efficient through well-structured prompts.
