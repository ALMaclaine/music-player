# Error Handling and Troubleshooting Prompt

When encountering an error or unexpected behavior, follow these steps:

1. Identify the Error:
   - Read the error message carefully.
   - Note the file and line number where the error occurred.
   - Identify the type of error (e.g., syntax error, runtime error, logical error).

2. Gather Context:
   - Review the code surrounding the error.
   - Check for any recent changes that might have introduced the error.
   - Verify the versions of all relevant dependencies.

3. Research the Error:
   - Search for the error message online.
   - Check official documentation for the technologies involved.
   - Look for similar issues in the project's issue tracker or community forums.

4. Attempt to Reproduce:
   - Create a minimal example that reproduces the error.
   - Test the error in different environments if applicable.

5. Debug:
   - Use appropriate debugging tools (e.g., console.log, debugger, IDE debugging features).
   - Set breakpoints and step through the code.
   - Inspect variable values and call stack.

6. Formulate Hypotheses:
   - Based on the gathered information, create hypotheses about what might be causing the error.
   - Prioritize these hypotheses from most to least likely.

7. Test Solutions:
   - Start with the most likely hypothesis.
   - Implement a potential fix.
   - Test thoroughly to ensure the fix resolves the issue without introducing new problems.

8. Document the Solution:
   - Once a solution is found, document the error, its cause, and the fix.
   - Update relevant documentation or comments in the code.

9. Prevent Future Occurrences:
   - Consider adding tests to catch similar errors in the future.
   - Refactor code if necessary to prevent similar issues.

10. Communicate:
    - If the error and solution might be relevant to others, share the findings with the team.
    - Update any related issues or tickets in the project management system.

Remember to approach error handling systematically and patiently. Not all errors have immediate solutions, and it's okay to seek help or take breaks when stuck.
