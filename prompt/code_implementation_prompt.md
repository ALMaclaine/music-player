# Code Implementation and File Creation Prompt

Use this prompt when implementing new features, creating new files, or modifying existing ones.

1. Clearly state the feature or functionality to be implemented.

2. If creating a new file:
   - Specify the file name and its location in the project structure.
   - Explain the purpose of the file and its role in the project.

3. If modifying an existing file:
   - Identify the file to be modified and its current location.
   - Explain what changes need to be made and why.

4. Outline the main components or functions to be implemented.

5. Consider and list any dependencies or imports required.

6. Implement the code, following these guidelines:
   - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
   - Include comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
   - Follow the project's coding standards and best practices.
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge case consideration.

7. If the implementation involves multiple files or components, explain how they interact.

8. Write unit tests for the new functionality:
   - Create a new test file if one doesn't exist, or add to the existing test file.
   - Write tests that cover the main functionality, edge cases, and potential error scenarios.
   - Ensure all tests pass before considering the implementation complete.

9. After implementation and testing, summarize the changes made and any important notes for future reference.

10. Update any relevant documentation based on the implementation.

11. Suggest any necessary updates to other parts of the codebase that might be affected by these changes.

Remember to keep the code modular, maintainable, and in line with the project's architecture and design principles. Always prioritize writing tests alongside the implementation to ensure code reliability and ease of future modifications.
